Purpose	                Defines the natural ordering of a class	                                Provides customized ordering for a class
Interface	            Implemented by the class being compared	                                Separate class or lambda expression
Compare Method	        compareTo(Object o), returns negative, zero, or positive value	        compare(Object o1, Object o2), returns negative, zero, or positive value
Single Sorting Rule	    Only one natural ordering per class	                                    Multiple custom ordering rules can be implemented
Intrinsic Ordering	    Cannot change the natural ordering after implementation	                Flexibility to change the ordering based on needs
Usage	                Automatically used by sorted collections like TreeSet or Arrays.sort()	Explicitly provided to sorting methods
