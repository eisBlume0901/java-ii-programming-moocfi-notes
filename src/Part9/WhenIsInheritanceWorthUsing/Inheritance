When inheriting, the subclass receives the functionality of the superclass.
- all the methods and interfaces from the superclass
- keep the inheritance hierarchy shallow since maintaining and further developing hierarchy becomes
more difficulty as it grows larger (improve the structure of the program if the inheritance hierarchy
is more than 2 or 3 levels deep)

When not to use inheritance?
- If an object owns or is composed of other objects
- Ensure that the Single Responsibility Principle holds true
  - if you notice that inheriting adds more responsibilities to a class, you should form multiple
  classes of class
