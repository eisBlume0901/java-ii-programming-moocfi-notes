State - fields, properties, or variables
Behavior - methods

Example:

class Car
{
    // State
    private String color;
    private String make;
    private String model;

    // Behavior
    void drive();
    void turn();
    void brake();
}

Instantiation - means creating an object from a class. It is the process of
    creating a new instance of a class. Abstract classes and interfaces
    cannot be instantiated because they are not concrete.

    Abstract class - cannot be instantiated because it does not have a
    complete implementation

    abstract class Shape
    {
        abstract void draw();
        // does not have a body since it serves as an outline
    }
    Interface - special type of class that cannot have state

    interface Drawable
    {
        void draw();
        // does not have a body since it serves as an outline for the class.
    }
