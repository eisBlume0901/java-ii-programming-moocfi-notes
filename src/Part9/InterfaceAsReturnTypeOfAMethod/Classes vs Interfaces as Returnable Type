Classes                 vs                  Interfaces
- concrete                                  - abstract
- have data members                         - does not have data members
                                              (instance variables)
- can only return its class                 - can return several classes
- can have constructors                     - cannot have constructors

For interfaces, we can return several different classes.
This is because an interface is a contract that defines
a set of methods that any class that implements the interface
must provide. The specific implementation of those methods can
vary from class to class.

ADVANTAGE OF USING INTERFACE: Reducing the dependencies between classes

Using interfaces in programming enables reducing dependencies between classes.
In the previous example the Packer does not depend on the classes that implement
 the Packable interface. Instead, it just depends on the interface. This makes
 possible to add new classes that implement the interface without changing the
 Packer class. What is more, adding new Packable classes doesn't affect the classes
 that use the Packer class.
