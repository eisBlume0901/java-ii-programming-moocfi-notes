Abstract class
- combines interface and inheritance
- cannot create instances of them but can only create instances of subclasses
of abstract class
- can include normal methods which have a method body, but it's also possible
to define abstract methods that only contain the method definition
(overridden through polymorphism)
- Implementing the abstract methods is the responsibility of subclasses
