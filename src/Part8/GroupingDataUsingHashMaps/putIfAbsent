putIfAbsent is a method in Java's Map interface that adds a new key-value pair
to the map only if the key is not already present. If the key is already present,
the method returns the existing value without modifying the map.
The method signature is:

V putIfAbsent(K key, V value)

Here, key is the key to be added to the map and value is the corresponding value.
If the key is already present in the map, the method returns the existing value
associated with the key. Otherwise, the method adds the key-value pair to the map
and returns null.

Example:
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

Integer oldValue = map.putIfAbsent("apple", 1);
if (oldValue != null)
{
    //key already present, do something with oldValue
}
else
{
    //key not present, new value added to map
}
