the equals method, so that all equal or approximately equal objects cause
the comparison to return true and all false for all the rest

public boolean equals - e

the hashCode method, so that as few objects as possible end up with the same
hash value

public boolean equals - explicitly defined in a class to override the
default implementation of.equals inherited from the Object class. A class
can customize the way it compares itself to other objects.

.equals - method that is already defined in the Object class and can be used
by any Java class without having to define it explicitly.

NOTE:
When you override the equals() method, it is generally recommended to also override the
hashCode() method to ensure consistency and maintaing contract between equality and hash code.

The contract between equals() and hashCode() states that:
1. If two objects are equal according to the equals() method, their hash codes must be equal
2. If two objects have equal hash codes, it does not necessarily mean they are equal according to
the equals() method.

hashCode() implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and properties of the class.
